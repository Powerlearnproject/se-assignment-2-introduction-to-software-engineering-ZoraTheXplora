Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

**Questions:**

**Define Software Engineering:** is the process of designing,developing and maintaining of a software product that was build using well explained methods and procedures.

**What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?** 
Software engineering is the process of maintaining softare products that are already in use meanwhile, Programming  is the act of manually writing,designing and implementing computer software using programming languages such as Python, C++, or Java.

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):** Stages followed when developing a software product.

**Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.**
1. **Requirement gathering and Analysis** - important information is gathered/collected from the users to develop the software product.
2. **Design** - The information gathered in the Software Requirement specification document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for for implementing system development is acquired. 
3. **Implementation/Coding** - Once the software developer receives the SRS/document,Source code is created by converting the software design. During this stage, every software component is put into use.
4. **Testing** - a prototype is released for testing and if bugs are found,the sample is returned to developers to get fixed.
5. **Deployment** - if the prototype is approved, the final product is released to the users/customers.
6. **Maintenance** - After launching of the software product on the the production environment.It gets maintained more often for any issues that may occur or software updates that need to be done.
   
**Agile vs. Waterfall Models:**

**Agile model** - is a method for managing projects and developing products that places an emphasis on adaptability, teamwork, and pleasing customers.

**Waterfall model** - is a method for developing software applied to large-scale, complex projects, usually in the information technology industry. It is distinguished by an organized, step-by-step method of developing software and managing projects.

**Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development.**

**Waterfall project management** -is a step-by-step approach suited for projects with clear goals and timelines. It involves thorough upfront planning to keep projects on track, with stages like initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closing.

**Advantages**:

1.Clear Planning: Detailed roadmap for each project stage.

2.Structured Approach: Methodical management style.

3.Progress Tracking: Easy monitoring of progress, risks, and budgets.

4.Managerial Control: Project managers have significant authority.

**Disadvantages**:

1.Inflexible to Changes: Requires extensive replanning for any changes.

2.Delayed Value: Value of completed tasks may only be seen at project's end.

3.High Adjustment Costs: Changes late in the process can be costly.

**Agile project management** - is a flexible approach widely used in software development. It lets teams adapt quickly to changes and deliver good results fast.
Agile focuses on teamwork, customer satisfaction, and breaking big projects into smaller parts. Teams work closely with customers to understand their needs and make improvements. They also aim to refine processes continually for better results.

**Advantages**

1.Adaptability: Handles changes in project requirements well.

2.Speed: Quickly adjusts to new information and feedback.

3.Visibility: Clearly tracks tasks and progress.

4.Quality: Emphasizes testing and improving quality.

**Disadvantages**

1.Customer Involvement: Needs customers to be involved in planning and feedback.

2.Project Management: Managers have less direct control.

3.Engineering Challenges: Changes may require redoing some work.

4.Cost and Time: Adding new features can increase costs and time.


**What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?**

Waterfall is good for projects with strict rules because it finishes each phase before starting the next. Agile is better for teams that want to move fast, try new ideas, and adjust plans along the way, especially when the final project isn't clear at the beginning.

**Requirements Engineering**:

**What is requirements engineering?**

**Requirements engineering** is a structured and thorough process of defining, creating, and verifying the needs for a software system. It involves various tasks to ensure a software product is effectively developed, including understanding, documenting, and managing stakeholders' demands.


**Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.**

1.**The feasibility study**

focuses on five main areas. Among these, Economic Feasibility Study is the most crucial, while Legal Feasibility Study is less emphasized.

a. **Technical Feasibility:** Assesses current resources like hardware, software, and technology needed for the project. It checks if the team has the right skills, if existing technology can be used, and if maintenance and upgrades are manageable.

b. **Operational Feasibility**: Analyzes how well the project can meet requirements and how easy it will be to use and maintain after deployment. It also considers if the proposed solution by the development team is acceptable.

c. **Economic Feasibility:** 

Evaluates the project's costs and benefits. This includes development, hardware and software, design, operational expenses, and more. It determines if the project will be financially beneficial for the organization.

2. **Requirements elicitation** - is an important part of designing software systems. It's about gathering information from stakeholders to understand what they need and expect. This involves methods like interviews, brainstorming sessions, task analysis, Delphi technique, and creating prototypes. These methods help analysts learn more about the project's domain and give them input for the next steps.

There are various methods for extracting requirements, such as:

a. **Interviews**: One-on-one talks with stakeholders are used to learn more about their requirements and expectations.
Surveys: Stakeholders are given questionnaires to complete in order to learn more about their requirements and expectations.
b. **Focus groups**: Stakeholders are gathered in small groups to talk about their requirements and expectations for the software system.
c. **Observation**: This method entails keeping an eye on the stakeholders in their workplace to learn about their requirements and expectations.
d. **Prototyping**: is a technique that entails building a functional model of the software system in order to validate requirements and get input from stakeholders.
To make sure that they are met, it is crucial to record, arrange, and rank the needs derived from each of these strategies.

3. **Requirements specifications**
   
It is through this process that formal software requirement models are created. These models provide a comprehensive specification of all the needs, including restrictions and non-functional as well as functional requirements. Further information about the problem can be needed during specification, which could again start the elicitation process. ER diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), function decomposition diagrams (FDDs), data dictionaries, etc. are some of the models that are being employed at this point. 
The process of clearly, consistently, and unambiguously defining the requirements found in the analysis step is known as requirements specification. Setting priorities and organizing the requirements into doable sections are also part of this process.Making a detailed and understandable document outlining the software system's needs is the aim of this step. The development team and the stakeholders should both be able to grasp this document.

Several types of requirements are commonly specified in this step, including:

a. **Functional Requirements**: These specify the functions that the software program must have. They outline the features that the system must have, including data storage, user interface, and input validation.
b. **Non-Functional Requirements**: These specify the level of performance that the software system must meet. They outline the system's quality qualities, including security, usability, performance, and dependability.
c. **Constraints:** These are any limits or limitations that need to be taken into account when creating the software system.
d. **Acceptance Criteria**: These spell out what has to happen in order for the software system to be deemed finished and prepared for distribution.

4. **Requirements Verification and Validation**

**Verification** is the process of ensuring that a particular function is implemented correctly by the program through a collection of tasks. 
**Validation** is the term for a distinct set of activities meant to guarantee that the developed software can be linked back to the needs of the client. Errors in the requirement definitions would spread to the subsequent phases and necessitate extensive modification and redo if requirements were not validated. 

This process's primary steps are as follows:

a.No two criteria should clash with one another; rather, all requirements should be compatible with one another.
b.The specifications must to be comprehensive in every way.
c.The specifications ought to be reachable in practice.

5. **Requirement Management**

The process of assessing, recording, monitoring, deciding upon, and prioritizing requirements as well as managing communication with pertinent parties is known as requirement management. The shifting nature of the requirements is handled at this step. It is vital to guarantee that the SRS exhibits maximum adaptability to accommodate eventual modifications in the needs stipulated by the end users. A crucial step in the requirements engineering process is making methodical, controlled changes to the software to meet the requirements. The practice of monitoring and controlling changes to requirements and making sure they remain applicable and valid throughout the software development life cycle is known as requirements management.

Several key activities are involved in requirements management, including:

a.**Monitoring and controlling changes**: This is keeping an eye on and managing modifications to the requirements as they arise during the development process. This includes figuring out where the changes came from, evaluating their effects, and deciding whether to accept or reject them.
Keeping track of several iterations of the requirements document and other relevant artifacts is part of version control.
Linking the requirements to other steps in the development process, such design, testing, and validation, is known as traceability.
b.**Communication**: This is making sure that all parties involved are informed of the requirements in an effective manner and that any modifications or problems are dealt with right away.
c.**Monitoring and reporting**: This entails keeping an eye on how the development process is going and providing updates on the requirements' state.

**Software Design Principles:**

1. **Avoid Tunnel Vision**:
   The design process should not only focus on achieving its goal but also consider other impacts and outcomes.

2. **Traceability to Analysis Model**:
   The design process should align with the analysis model, ensuring it meets all the software requirements to create a high-quality product.

3. **Avoid Reinventing the Wheel**:
   The design process should not waste time or effort by duplicating things that already exist. This approach speeds up overall development.

4. **Minimize Intellectual Distance**:
   The design process should bridge the gap between real-world problems and software solutions, simplifying complex concepts and making them easier to understand and implement.
   
5. **Exhibit Uniformity and Integration**:
   The design should be consistent throughout the process and integrate all parts of the software into a cohesive system.

6. **Accommodate Change**:
   The software should be flexible enough to adapt to changes as needed, based on user requirements.

7. **Degrade Gracefully**:
   The software should continue to function properly even if errors occur during execution, ensuring smooth operation under unexpected conditions.

8. **Assess for Quality**:
   The design should undergo evaluation to ensure high quality, focusing on assessing its effectiveness and reliability.

9. **Review to Discover Errors**:
   The design should be thoroughly reviewed to identify and minimize any errors, ensuring it meets the desired standards of performance and functionality.

10. **Designing is different from coding**:
    Design involves planning how a program will solve a problem, outlining its logic. Coding, on the other hand, is the process of using a specific language to actually create the program based on that 
    design.
   

**Explain the concept of modularity in software design**

Modularity is the process of dismantling a large, complicated system into smaller, easier-to-manage parts or modules.

**How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?** 

Each module is made to carry out a particular duty or function, and these modules are made to cooperate in order to accomplish the system's overall functionality.

**Testing in Software Engineering:**

**Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing)**

1. **Unit testing** - in this kind of testing, mistakes are found one by one in each part or unit by testing them separately. This ensures that each part or unit of the software is suitable for use by the developers. These parts or units are the smallest parts of the software that can be tested.
2. **integration testing** - in this testing, we put together parts that were tested separately to see how they work together. We check if they do what they're supposed to do and find any problems in how they connect with each other.
3. **system testing** - In system testing, the entire software is tested as a whole. This means all the parts that make up the system are tested together to make sure they meet the system's needs.
4. **acceptance testing** - this type of testing is done to make sure the software meets the users' needs and works properly in their environment before it's given to them.

**Why is testing crucial in software development?**

In software development, testing is essential for finding flaws, guaranteeing quality, reducing risks, increasing user pleasure, and saving money and time by spotting problems early on.
   
   
**Version Control Systems:**

**What are version control systems**

Version control systems - It's a system that keeps track of changes made to files or a group of files over time, allowing you to retrieve specific versions later on.

**why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.**
They play a significant role in software development by promoting collaboration, preserving a record of alterations, aiding in code examination, assisting in debugging, and upholding the stability and integrity of the code.e.g. Git, Bitbucket,Github.

**Software Project Management:** 

Software project management involves several other plans in addition to the major ones, such as quality assurance plans and configuration management plans. These plans help ensure that the final product meets the required standards and the project is completed successfully.

**Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?**

1. **Project Estimation**: This is the first step in software project management, where the size of the project is estimated. This size estimation serves as the basis for the estimation of other important parameters such as cost, duration, and effort.
2. **Cost Estimation**: This involves calculating the total expenses required to develop the software product.
3. **Time Estimation**: This is the process of calculating the total time needed to complete the project.
4. **Risk Management**: The project manager should identify the unanticipated risks that may occur during project development risk, analyze the damage that might cause these risks, and take a risk reduction plan to cope with these risks.


Challenges faced in managing software project?

Answer: 1.Unclear and undefined expectations - Not knowing exactly what is expected.
2. Time constraint - Limited time to complete tasks.
3.Changing project requirements and priorities - Project needs and priorities keep shifting.
4.Poor communication - Not effectively sharing information.
5.Skills management - Handling team members' skills properly.
6.Changing technologies - Technologies are constantly evolving.
7. Keeping everyone on the same page - Ensuring everyone understands and agrees on the same things.

**Software Maintenance:**

**Define software maintenance:**  

**Software Maintenance** - is about changing and updating a software system after it’s given to the customer. 

**explain the different types of maintenance activities:**

1. **Corrective Maintenance**: Fixing mistakes and bugs in the software.
2. **Patching**: A quick fix due to management pressure, often leading to new errors because it isn't thoroughly checked.
3. **Adaptive Maintenance**: Changing the software to fit new environments, like new hardware, software, laws, or business rules.
4. **Perfective Maintenance**: Enhancing functionality, performance, and reliability, and making the software easier to change.
5. **Preventive Maintenance**: Taking steps to avoid future issues, like optimizing, updating documentation, reviewing and testing the system, and setting up backups.

**Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?**

It's an important part of the software development life cycle (SDLC) to make sure the software keeps meeting user needs over time. Without maintenance, any software will eventually become outdated and useless.

**Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering****

**What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?**
