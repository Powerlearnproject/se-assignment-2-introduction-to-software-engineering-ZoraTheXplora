Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:

Define Software Engineering:is the process of designing,developing and maintaining of a software product that was build using well explained methods and procedures.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software engineering is the process of maintaining softare products that are already in use meanwhile, Programming  is the act of manually writing,designing and implementing computer software using programming languages such as Python, C++, or Java.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Stages followed when developing a software product.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirement gathering and Analysis - important information is gathered/collected from the users to develop the software product.
2. Design - The information gathered in the Software Requirement specification document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for for implementing system development is acquired. 
3. Implementation/Coding - Once the software developer receives the SRS/document,Source code is created by converting the software design. During this stage, every software component is put into use.
4. Testing - a prototype is released for testing and if bugs are found,the sample is returned to developers to get fixed.
5. Deployment - if the prototype is approved, the final product is released to the users/customers.
6. Maintenance - After launching of the software product on the the production environment.It gets maintained more often for any issues that may occur or software updates that need to be done.
   
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile model - is a method for managing projects and developing products that places an emphasis on adaptability, teamwork, and pleasing customers.
Waterfall model - is a method for developing software applied to large-scale, complex projects, usually in the information technology industry. It is distinguished by an organized, step-by-step method of developing software and managing projects.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity is the process of dismantling a large, complicated system into smaller, easier-to-manage parts or modules. Each module is made to carry out a particular duty or function, and these modules are made to cooperate in order to accomplish the system's overall functionality.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
1. Unit testing - in this kind of testing, mistakes are found one by one in each part or unit by testing them separately. This ensures that each part or unit of the software is suitable for use by the developers. These parts or units are the smallest parts of the software that can be tested.
2. integration testing - in this testing, we put together parts that were tested separately to see how they work together. We check if they do what they're supposed to do and find any problems in how they connect with each other.
3. system testing - In system testing, the entire software is tested as a whole. This means all the parts that make up the system are tested together to make sure they meet the system's needs.
4. acceptance testing - this type of testing is done to make sure the software meets the users' needs and works properly in their environment before it's given to them.

Why is testing crucial in software development?
In software development, testing is essential for finding flaws, guaranteeing quality, reducing risks, increasing user pleasure, and saving money and time by spotting problems early on.
   
   
Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems - It's a system that keeps track of changes made to files or a group of files over time, allowing you to retrieve specific versions later on.
They play a significant role in software development by promoting collaboration, preserving a record of alterations, aiding in code examination, assisting in debugging, and upholding the stability and integrity of the code.
e.g. Git, Bitbucket,Github.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Answer: Project Estimation: This is the first step in software project management, where the size of the project is estimated. This size estimation serves as the basis for the estimation of other important parameters such as cost, duration, and effort.
Cost Estimation: This involves calculating the total expenses required to develop the software product.
Time Estimation: This is the process of calculating the total time needed to complete the project.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
