# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:is the process of designing,developing and maintaining of a software product that was build using well explained methods and procedures.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software engineering is the process of maintaining softare products that are already in use meanwhile, Programming  is the act of manually writing,designing and implementing computer software using programming languages such as Python, C++, or Java.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):Stages followed when developing a software product.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Requirement gathering and Analysis - important information is gathered/collected from the users to develop the software product.
2. Design - The information gathered in the Software Requirement specification document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for for implementing system development is acquired. 
3. Implementation/Coding - Once the software developer receives the SRS/document,Source code is created by converting the software design. During this stage, every software component is put into use.
4. Testing - a prototype is released for testing and if bugs are found,the sample is returned to developers to get fixed.
5. Deployment - if the prototype is approved, the final product is released to the users/customers.
6. Maintenance - After launching of the software product on the the production environment.It gets maintained more often for any issues that may occur or software updates that need to be done.
   
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
