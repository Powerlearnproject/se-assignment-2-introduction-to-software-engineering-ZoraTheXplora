Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

**Questions:**

**Define Software Engineering:** is the process of designing,developing and maintaining of a software product that was build using well explained methods and procedures.

**What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?** 
Software engineering is the process of maintaining softare products that are already in use meanwhile, Programming  is the act of manually writing,designing and implementing computer software using programming languages such as Python, C++, or Java.

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):** Stages followed when developing a software product.

**Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.**
1. **Requirement gathering and Analysis** - important information is gathered/collected from the users to develop the software product.
2. **Design** - The information gathered in the Software Requirement specification document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for for implementing system development is acquired. 
3. **Implementation/Coding** - Once the software developer receives the SRS/document,Source code is created by converting the software design. During this stage, every software component is put into use.
4. **Testing** - a prototype is released for testing and if bugs are found,the sample is returned to developers to get fixed.
5. **Deployment** - if the prototype is approved, the final product is released to the users/customers.
6. **Maintenance** - After launching of the software product on the the production environment.It gets maintained more often for any issues that may occur or software updates that need to be done.
   
**Agile vs. Waterfall Models:**
**Agile model** - is a method for managing projects and developing products that places an emphasis on adaptability, teamwork, and pleasing customers.
**Waterfall model** - is a method for developing software applied to large-scale, complex projects, usually in the information technology industry. It is distinguished by an organized, step-by-step method of developing software and managing projects.

**Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development.**
**Waterfall project management** -is a step-by-step approach suited for projects with clear goals and timelines. It involves thorough upfront planning to keep projects on track, with stages like initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closing.

**Advantages**:
Clear Planning: Detailed roadmap for each project stage.
Structured Approach: Methodical management style.
Progress Tracking: Easy monitoring of progress, risks, and budgets.
Managerial Control: Project managers have significant authority.

**Disadvantages**:
Inflexible to Changes: Requires extensive replanning for any changes.
Delayed Value: Value of completed tasks may only be seen at project's end.
High Adjustment Costs: Changes late in the process can be costly.

**Agile project management** - is a flexible approach widely used in software development. It lets teams adapt quickly to changes and deliver good results fast.
Agile focuses on teamwork, customer satisfaction, and breaking big projects into smaller parts. Teams work closely with customers to understand their needs and make improvements. They also aim to refine processes continually for better results.

**Advantages**
Adaptability: Handles changes in project requirements well.
Speed: Quickly adjusts to new information and feedback.
Visibility: Clearly tracks tasks and progress.
Quality: Emphasizes testing and improving quality.
Cons of agile:

**Disadvantages**
Customer Involvement: Needs customers to be involved in planning and feedback.
Project Management: Managers have less direct control.
Engineering Challenges: Changes may require redoing some work.
Cost and Time: Adding new features can increase costs and time.


**What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?**
Waterfall is good for projects with strict rules because it finishes each phase before starting the next. Agile is better for teams that want to move fast, try new ideas, and adjust plans along the way, especially when the final project isn't clear at the beginning.

**Requirements Engineering**:

**What is requirements engineering?**

Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity is the process of dismantling a large, complicated system into smaller, easier-to-manage parts or modules. Each module is made to carry out a particular duty or function, and these modules are made to cooperate in order to accomplish the system's overall functionality.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
1. Unit testing - in this kind of testing, mistakes are found one by one in each part or unit by testing them separately. This ensures that each part or unit of the software is suitable for use by the developers. These parts or units are the smallest parts of the software that can be tested.
2. integration testing - in this testing, we put together parts that were tested separately to see how they work together. We check if they do what they're supposed to do and find any problems in how they connect with each other.
3. system testing - In system testing, the entire software is tested as a whole. This means all the parts that make up the system are tested together to make sure they meet the system's needs.
4. acceptance testing - this type of testing is done to make sure the software meets the users' needs and works properly in their environment before it's given to them.

Why is testing crucial in software development?
In software development, testing is essential for finding flaws, guaranteeing quality, reducing risks, increasing user pleasure, and saving money and time by spotting problems early on.
   
   
Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems - It's a system that keeps track of changes made to files or a group of files over time, allowing you to retrieve specific versions later on.
They play a significant role in software development by promoting collaboration, preserving a record of alterations, aiding in code examination, assisting in debugging, and upholding the stability and integrity of the code.
e.g. Git, Bitbucket,Github.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Answer: Project Estimation: This is the first step in software project management, where the size of the project is estimated. This size estimation serves as the basis for the estimation of other important parameters such as cost, duration, and effort.
Cost Estimation: This involves calculating the total expenses required to develop the software product.
Time Estimation: This is the process of calculating the total time needed to complete the project.
Risk Management - The project manager should identify the unanticipated risks that may occur during project development risk, analyze the damage that might cause these risks, and take a risk reduction plan to cope with these risks.
Software project management involves several other plans in addition to the major ones, such as quality assurance plans and configuration management plans. These plans help ensure that the final product meets the required standards and the project is completed successfully.

Challenges faced in managing software project?

Answer: 1.Unclear and undefined expectations - Not knowing exactly what is expected.
2. Time constraint - Limited time to complete tasks.
3.Changing project requirements and priorities - Project needs and priorities keep shifting.
4.Poor communication - Not effectively sharing information.
5.Skills management - Handling team members' skills properly.
6.Changing technologies - Technologies are constantly evolving.
7. Keeping everyone on the same page - Ensuring everyone understands and agrees on the same things.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance:  

Answer: Software Maintenance - is about changing and updating a software system after itâ€™s given to the customer. 

explain the different types of maintenance activities:

Answer : 1. Corrective Maintenance: Fixing mistakes and bugs in the software.
2. Patching: A quick fix due to management pressure, often leading to new errors because it isn't thoroughly checked.
3. Adaptive Maintenance: Changing the software to fit new environments, like new hardware, software, laws, or business rules.
4. Perfective Maintenance: Enhancing functionality, performance, and reliability, and making the software easier to change.
5. Preventive Maintenance: Taking steps to avoid future issues, like optimizing, updating documentation, reviewing and testing the system, and setting up backups.

Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Answer :It's an important part of the software development life cycle (SDLC) to make sure the software keeps meeting user needs over time. Without maintenance, any software will eventually become outdated and useless.

*Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering*

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
